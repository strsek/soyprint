Mapping the land-use footprint of Brazilian soy embodied in international consumption: A spatially explicit input-output approach

 - Code files are numbered in chronological order.
   - 0-5 build the subnational data foundation
   - 6-7 model subnational transport flows
   - 8-9 connect flows to importing countries, benchmark them and assess model sensitivity
   - 10-17 nest the subnational supply chain flows into FABIO
   - 18-19 compute land-use footprints on municipal level and refined them to the grid level (30m)

 - As many input files are quite large, please request the full input data if you are interested in running the code
